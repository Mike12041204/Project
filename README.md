Honors Data Structures and Algorithms Group Project

Authors: Michael Greenbaum and Duwon Ham

This project simulates a movie cinema with multiple theaters showing different movies and multiple lines to enqueue customers.
The code allows for the user through the input driven driver to test the cinema by adding new customers, entering them into
theaters, and removing them from the cinema.

The code is designed to use multiple data structures to speed up the operations of the cinema.
